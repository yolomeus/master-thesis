\chapter{Introduction}
Due to large successes in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) and many other fields, machine learning (ML) and in particular deep learning (DL) have gained popularity in the research community and among practitioners. Both as object of research and in real world applications these methods have been widely adopted and shown to be effective for several use cases.

One major field, in which ML and DL has been playing an increasingly important role is information retrieval (IR). Not only has "Neural Information Retrieval" \cite{mitra2018an} been acknowledged as promising field of research within the IR research community, but it is already present in modern web IR systems used by google, amazon, netflix and other major companies, which do heavily rely on ML for delivering relevant content to their users.

While these systems most certainly do not solely operate on raw text, when it comes to to finding relevant documents for a given natural language query, the task of text ranking still lies at the heart of the problem.

In 2018 NLP experienced a major breakthrough when \cite{devlin-etal-2019-bert}. Core idea pretrain, finetune...
While progress in pretraining lms and using for downstream task have been made before this that, this was first time the model achieved sota by large maring on variety of nlp benchmarks. and is often referred to as "the imagenet moment of NLP".

subfields including text ranking of nlp became aware and started to use.

\section{Motivation}
Nowadays, modern approaches for NLP often rely on large language models. These models are first pre-trained on huge amounts of text data and then fine-tuned on a smaller, task specific dataset. Although this approach has shown great effectiveness compared to traditional approaches, due to their size and complexity, these language models are mostly being treated as black boxes.

This is where several issues arise.
