\section{Motivation}
Nowadays, modern approaches for NLP often rely on large language models. These models are first pre-trained on huge amounts of text data and then fine-tuned on a smaller, task specific dataset. Although this approach has shown great effectiveness compared to traditional approaches, due to their size and complexity, these language models are mostly being treated as black boxes.

This is where several issues arise.
