\section{Probing}
To assess the distribution of knowledge across layers of a BERT model, we design a set of tasks that require information on different abstraction levels in order to be solved.

For each task, we generate a dataset by sampling instances from the MSMARCO validation and test set and automatically infer targets. In the following we provide a list of all probing tasks and details on the corresponding dataset generation process.
